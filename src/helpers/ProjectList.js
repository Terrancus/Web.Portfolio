I partook the project as the concept artist and UI designer. It was in this group project that we've found each other, and formed the aspiring indie game dev team I now belong to.\n\n        The competition only allowed 7 days to develop the game, meanwhile this is also our first experience in a full development cycle; As a result, the game is not optimized and bug free due to the rush and our inexperience. Nevertheless, this project gave me invaluable experience in game development.",

My works are generally low-poly in nature, with objects often found in action/ war related games, as they are my interested genre of game dev."

The language is a fusion between pictographic and alphabetic language, in which all letters are assigned with a fixed phoneme, and a fixed meaning implied by its pictographic design; All words in the lexicon of this language are designed non-arbitrarily, but by combining meaningful letters logically in order to “spell the meaning” as much as they spell their pronunciation. The above image is an example of how this language can be used to translate poetry.\n\n        A dedicated website for the details of the language may be developed in the future."

The play is about a young boxer approaching his boxing coach to explain his reason for quitting the gym, due to his disappointment of his performance, and opened up a thought provoking conversation between fantasy and reality in the fighting ring. The story is a dialectic discourse with an analogy for the meaning of life, discussing its common disappointments, and the reason for it to be continued.\n\n        A seperate page for the full play will be added soon."
